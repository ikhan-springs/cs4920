# CS 4920

This repository contains my Java programming assignments for the course CS 4920: Introduction to Applied Cryptography.

CS 4920 explores basic security issues in computer communication, classical cryptographic algorithms, symmetric-key cryptography, public-key cryptography, authentication, and digital signatures.

I completed this course at UCCS in May 2022. A brief description of the outcome of each project is given below. A more detailed description can be found at the top of each program file.
